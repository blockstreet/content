# Cryptocurrency Education
Welcome to the education section! It is our goal to teach people how cryptocurrency and blockchain technology work, how they can change the world, and how you can get involved. We want our content to be as simple as possible so that anyone can understand it, and we try to use analogies with things from everyday life to explain technical concepts easily.

## Where to start
This guide is broken into two main parts: Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. The Cryptocurrency section is a good place to start if you are an investor, trader, or just want to know more about what cryptocurrencies do. If you are an engineer, entrepreneur or just wish to get the full picture of the ecyosystem, the Blockchain section would be a good place to start.

## How to navigate
The left hand navigation lists the two main parts of the guide and all of the topics related to each as individual pages. We suggest navigating top to bottom through the list. Every page in the education guide you visit will start out with an overview of the topic. If the topic isn't something that interests you, or you want to revisit it later, then you can just read the overview and continue to another page in the guide.
