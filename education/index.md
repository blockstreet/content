# Cryptocurrency Education
Welcome to the education section! This is a constantly expanding portion of the site that will grow in both content and clarity over time. It is our goal to teach people how cryptocurrency and blockchain technology work, how they can change the world, and how you can get involved. We want our content to be as simple as possible so that anyone can understand it. We often try to use analogies with familiar things from everyday life to explain technical concepts easily. We plan to support our written content with visual aids in the form of artwork and animations as this section continues to change.

## Where to start
This guide is broken into two main parts: Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. We suggest starting in the Cryptocurrency section if you are an investor, trader, or wish to get the big picture of the ecosystem. If you are an engineer, entrepreneur or just wish to get the full picture of the ecyosystem; we suggest you start with the Blockchain section, and move to the Cryptocurrency section afterwards.

## How to navigate
The left hand navigation lists the two main parts of the guide and all of the topics related to each as individual pages. We suggest navigating top to bottom through the list. Every page in the education guide you visit will start out with an overview of the topic. If the topic isn't something that interests you, or you want to revisit it later, then you can just read the overview and continue to another page in the guide.
