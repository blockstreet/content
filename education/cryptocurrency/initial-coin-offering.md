# Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
Many blockchain projects and companies are raising money via cryptocurrency crowdfunding, popularly known as 'initial coin offerings' (or ICOs). Similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) for the stock market, investors provide early funding to a new project or company in exchange for a pre-determined amount of shares (or coins). When the project or company's coin is launched, coins are given out to investors and can be traded on exchanges.
 
## How do I participate in an ICO?
Every cryptocurrency does their ICO differently, so the best way to participate is usually to go to the official website; almost every cryptocurrency will list instructions on how to get in on the ICO.

#### Why do people invest in ICOs?
Some investors like ICOs because their investment is both a way to support an open-source project and take advantage of the cryptocurrency's potential increase in value. Some past ICOs  of interest include the [Humaniq Project](https://humaniq.co/?_ga=2.129434761.488867700.1493844992-998258822.1493844750), whose mission is to offer a secure and simple banking tool for people who can't get a bank account any other way and [Kin](https://kin.kik.com/#Newsletter) (by the popular messaging company Kik) which is designed to be used for everyday digital services like payment.
 
#### Regulation & Standards
While new ICOs are launched often, there are very few standards or government regulation. This makes citizens of many countries, including the United States, unable to participate in some ICOs.

#### Where can I find upcoming ICOs?
Upcoming ICOs can be found on sites such as [ICO Countdown](http://www.icocountdown.com/). Please make sure you research, analyze, and/or speak to members of the company or project launching the ICO before investing.
