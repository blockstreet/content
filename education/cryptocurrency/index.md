# Cryptocurrency
Crypto is a short way to say cryptography, which is the study of using math to keep something secret and safe. So when you put “crypto” and “currency” together, you get cryptocurrency; money that is kept safe using math.

## Where did it all begin?
In 2008, a person (or group of people) using the fake name "Satoshi Nakamoto" wrote a paper about a digital money system he called "Bitcoin", which used something he called a "Blockchain". This paper and the underlying technology has inspired people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies since then.

## What makes it so exciting?
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that there is no single person/bank/entity that has control over your money.
