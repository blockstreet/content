# Risk
For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, investment risk is very similar to that of a public stock. Risk boils down to three main categories: education, price stability, and coin security.

### Education Importance
Education of how cryptocurrency technology works, how one coin is unique from others, and what changes to a cryptocurrency blockchain may occur are all important factors before investing. Just like analyzing a company before investing in their stock, investors should thoroughly analyze a cryptocurrency and understand what makes an investment in one coin better than another. Areas of consideration may be:
- Coin Price
- Coin Features
- Applicable Use Cases
- Scalability
- External or Enterprise Support
- Coin Resources & Skill

### Price Stability
Because cryptocurrencies vary in supply, price stability is based on the supply and demand on exchanges. Since cryptocurrencies differ in design, investors should consider things like coin supply limits and amount of coins the founders are holding (or releasing at a later date). Just like fiat currencies, prices are also impacted by factors outside of the cryptocurrency's control such as major news or the coin's dependence on another cryptocurrency.

### Coin Security
How a person stores and secures their cryptocurrencies also determines their investment risk. People who are knowledgable about blockchain technology may increase coin security by saving their coins on their own computer using password-protected wallets. Other investors might leave their coins on an exchange wallet and treat the coin like stock sitting in an E-Trade account. Although exchanges are becoming more reliable and user-friendly, investors should understand that exchanges trade huge amounts of fiat currency and cryptocurrency on a dialy basis. Because of this, exchanges are prone to higher security threats (it's kind of like 100 years ago when banks were threatened by theives). It is important to understand that exchanges vary in their insurance policies for digital and fiat currencies. The exchange Coinbase was among the first to receive FDIC insurance for U.S. residents' fiat currency, protecting up to a maximum of $250,000 per investor.
