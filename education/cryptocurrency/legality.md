# Legality
The use and trade of bitcoin is legal in all but a few countries. However, whether it is considered legal tender (money) or a commodity differs by location. While governments are still exploring and learning about cryptocurrencies, they have made sure to warn the public of the risks involved in using, investing, or trading them. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) people who exchange virtual currency for goods and services are doing so legally, and those who create (or mine) Bitcoin and invest in virtual currencies are not subject to regulation.

## United States
Although most countries have no regulation around Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, the United States has been among the first to include cryptocurrencies in legal documents and provide guidelines to people using, investing, or trading. The US Treasury considers Bitcoin "a convertible decentralized virtual currency" while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) considers it a commodity. The IRS has published a [guide](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance) stating that general tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to 'virtual currency' (or cryptocurrencies). This means using Bitcoin for transactions that normally use US Dollars, like paying an employee, are taxable to the employee and “must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.” The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have also made their voice heard as the SEC issued an investor alert about the potential risks of virtual currency investments while NASAA labeled it as a "major threat to investors".

Luckily, popular exchanges such as [Coinbase](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1496488-how-do-i-report-taxes-) provide a specialized Cost Basis for Taxes report which will help individuals with filing their taxes, including a summary of capital gains or losses. Large financial services companies such as Fidelity have also started integrating Coinbase for their clients to see both their U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency holdings in one place.
