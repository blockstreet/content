# Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
Many blockchain projects and companies are raising money via
cryptocurrency crowdfunding,"known as 'initial coin offerings"
(ICOs). The idea is similar to the stock market's initial public offerings
(IPOs) where investors provide early funding to a new project or company in
exchange for a pre-determined amount of shares of stock. When the
project or company's coin is launched, coins are given out to investors
in the ICO and can be traded on exchanges.
