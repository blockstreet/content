# Economics
The point of cryptocurrencies is to be just like government issued money (fiat, like the US dollar), except that there is no one group that is in control of the money (which is why we call it decentralized). The two main things that affect the price of cryptocurrencies are supply & demand, and inflation & deflation.

## Supply & Demand
The strongest forces that control the value of something are supply & demand. Supply is how much of something is available, and demand is how much people want to buy it. If something has a high supply or a low demand, its price will be low. If something has a low supply or a high demand, its price will be high.

## Inflation & Deflation
It might sound weird, but supply and demand can even affect how much money is worth. When a government prints fiat (for example the US dollar), they are increasing the supply of that fiat. When its supply goes up, its worth goes down; this is called inflation. The same thing happens to cryptocurrencies; when more coins are created, each coin is worth a little bit less than it used to be. Deflation is the opposite of inflation. If a government stopped printing fiat, the supply would go down (becuase of all the money that gets lost or destroyed), which would make the fiat worth more. Similar to fiat, if a cryptocurrency stops mining new coins, each coin will become worth a little bit more than it used to be

### What makes it valuable?
Let's use an example to show what makes a cryptocurrency valuable.

**The US Dollar** is a currency used to buy things in the United States. A dollar is a piece of paper with some numbers on it. What makes it worth anything? A few decades ago, the US dollar was backed by gold, meaning that for dollar that existed, there was a little bit of gold being held in a safe somewhere. If you wanted, you could trade your dollar for that gold. But the dollar hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm). If we went back in time to 1933, we could say that the dollar had value because it could be traded for gold, but now that isn't really true...the dollar has value now because everyone agrees that it has value.

#### Are cryptocurrencies a limited resource?
For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" that are available at any given time. You can't just "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet. Coins are created by "miners" who are kinda like a government's mint. Because miners can only create a limited number of coins in most cryptocurrencies, the coins are a limited resource.

#### Do they have intrinsic value?
It depends on the cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin is very similar to the US dollar, so its pricedepends on both supply & demand and inflation & deflation. Other cryptocurrencies (for example Ethereum) have value because their coins are backed by something else. Ethereum is backed by computer programs, so you can exchange your coins to run the program if you want.

## Who buys cryptocurrencies?
There are a lot of different people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are many currencies, each trying to solve existing problems of the centralized systems, or create new applications using blockchain technology.

#### Day Traders
Just like in the stock market, there are people who want to make money based on the changing prices of cryptocurrencies. They buy a currency when they think the price is low and sell it when the price is higher.

#### Holders
Some people believe that cryptocurrencies will change the way people use money. They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become common, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to buying food at a restaurant. Holders are buying coins now and planning on keeping them for a long time (because they believe the price will be much higher in a few years).

#### Corporations
Some large companies like Microsoft, Santander, and JP Morgan (to name a few) are interested in cryptocurrencies as well. These companies may try to use blockchain technology to make themselves more efficient and save money by taking advantage of some of the things cryptocurrencies and blockchain can do.
