# Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
Many blockchain projects and companies are raising money via
cryptocurrency crowdfunding,"known as 'initial coin offerings"
(ICOs). The idea is similar to the stock market's initial public offerings
(IPOs) where investors provide early funding to a new project or company in
exchange for a pre-determined amount of shares of stock. When the
project or company's coin is launched, coins are given out to investors
in the ICO and can be traded on exchanges.
 
### How do I participate in an ICO?
Every cryptocurrency does their ICO differently, so the best way to
participate is usually to go to the official website; almost every
cryptocurrency will list instructions on how to get in on the ICO.

### Why do people invest in ICOs?
Some investors like ICOs because their investment is both a way to
support a new project and take advantage of the cryptocurrency's
potential increase in value. Some examples ofpast ICOs include the
[Humaniq Project](https://humaniq.co/?_ga=2.129434761.488867700.1493844992-998258822.1493844750),
whose mission is to offer a secure and simple banking tool for people
who can't get a bank account any other way and
[Kin](https://kin.kik.com/#Newsletter) (by the popular messaging
company Kik) which is designed to be used for everyday digital services
like payment.
 
### Regulation & Standards
While new ICOs are launched often, there are very few standards or
government regulation. This makes citizens of many countries, including 
the United States, unable to participate in some ICOs.

### Where can I find upcoming ICOs?
Upcoming ICOs can be found on sites such as
[ICO Countdown](http://www.icocountdown.com/). Please make sure you
research, analyze, and/or speak to members of the company or project
launching the ICO before investing.
