# Immutability
If something is immutable, it cannot be changed.

## Think of it like this
When it comes to digital immutability, you can think of it as something that is "written in stone". It is impossible to change in anyway, for better or worse.

Every block in the blockchain is like a note written in permanent marker that is laminated after. There's no way to go back and change what was written on the note. This assures that every transaction is permanent.

The more people who have copies of the blockchain, the more secure it is because the more "backups" there are. This means that if an evil party wanted to change the history of the blockchain, they would need to make changes to other peoples' copies of the blockchain. At a certain point, making that many changes becomes very, very difficult.

## Example
If Alice sent Bob 5 coins, the transaction is written down on a note and laminated. If there was a mistake (like Alice not having enough coins), then her note would still be on the blockchain. The note would say that her attempt to give 5 coins to Bob never worked, as opposed to never being added to the blockchain at all.
