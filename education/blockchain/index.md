# Blockchain
In order to understand what cryptocurrency is, it's important to understand what a blockchain is. A blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. A blockchain is a list of messages where a part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a big notebook of transactions with page numbers. By looking at the last page of this notebook (or the last block in the blockchain), you can tell how much money a person has, by seeing all the transactions that took place.

A great thing about a blockchain is that it's very easy to verify its authenticity, because everyone gets a copy of it. One person can't go back and change or overwrite previous transactions, because they are secured by hashes. You can think of this as them being "written in stone".  If I tried to go back and erase a transaction, it would leave an easily visible mark, so other people looking at it would know something is wrong. In order to reverse a transaction, you'd have to create a new transaction which reverses the old transaction.
