# Decentralization
Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means that nobody who owns cryptocurrency has more information or power than anyone else. 

### Think of it like this
In a decentralized bank, every customer gets a copy of the bank records(**blockchain**), so everyone can see how much money everyone else has.

### Why is decentralization important?

Decentralization spreads out the information, so no one user/person/entity has absolute control over it.  Normal banks are *centralized*; although we all put our money into it, the bank has the final say in how much each person has. If I put in $100 to my account, the only people that know how much I deposited are me and the bank. The bank could just tell every other customer that I only have $1 in my account, and there isn't much I can do to prove them wrong. In a decentralized bank, if a teller at the bank tries to tell everyone I only have $1, anyone can look at the bank records(**blockchain**) to see that I really have 100$.

Another reason why decentralization is important is because it stops a service(like a bank, or program) from having a single point of failure. Pretend the CEO of the centralized bank is the only one that can see the records. If the CEO's computer, which contained the only copy of all the bank records, suddenly got a virus and broke, there would be no official record of anyone's money. In a decentralized version, because everyone has all of the records, if a single person's records were destroyed, they could get a copy from anyone else who uses the bank.
