# Wallets
A digital wallet is a place for you to store your cryptocurrency. A wallet may contain one or more addresses, which are used to hold cryptocurrencies.

## Addresses
A blockchain address is a number that can be used to send cryptocurrency to a specific wallet. A wallet can have many addresses, which are reusable, and it is easy to create another address.


### Think of it like this
A digital wallet like a personal post office, and addresses are Post Office(PO) boxes in that office. You can recieve mail(cryptocurrency), which is stored in one of your PO boxes(addresses). If you wanted, you could have one PO box which is for recieving mail from friends and family, one for work related things, and one for any other kind of mail.

An address is like a free PO box, made of bullet proof glass. Other people know that if they want to send you something, they can send it to your mailbox. Only you have the key, so only you can open the mailbox and retrieve the contents. Because it's made of glass, anyone who goes to the post office can look and see what's inside of it(for Ethereum, anyone can use [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) to see what an address holds, [https://www.walletexplorer.com](https://www.walletexplorer.com) is the Bitcoin equivalent), but can't take anything out of it.
