# Wallets
A digital wallet is a place for you to store your cryptocurrency.

### Think of it like this
A digital wallet like a bank account; you can put your money in and take your money out, but you never want to give somebody else access to your wallet.

## Addresses
A blockchain address is a number that can be used to send cryptocurrency to a specific wallet. A wallet can have many addresses, but each address should only be used once.

### Think of it like this
An address is like a free post office box, made of bullet proof glass. Other people know that if they want to send you something, they can send it to your mailbox. Only you have the key, so only you can open the mailbox and retrieve the contents. Because it's made of glass, anyone who goes to the post office can look and see what's inside of it(for Ethereum, anyone can use [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) to see what an address holds, [https://www.walletexplorer.com](https://www.walletexplorer.com) is the Bitcoin equivalent), but can't take anything out of it. Post office boxes(addresses) are easy to create, and if you want a new one, you can just request one and have people send things to your new box(address).
