# Digital Signature
A digital signature is a way to show that a document or message is authentic. It shows that certain person authorized something, it can from that person, and the message was not changed.

### Think of it like this
A digital signature is for computers what a hand-written signature is for paper, except more secure; it shows that a person is who they say they are.

## Public and Private Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for digital signatures, and their names give us hints about how they are used. 

### Private Key
A private (sometimes called secret) key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to put your digital signature on something.

### Public Key
A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your digital signature is actually yours.
