# Use cases
What are some of the use cases for Blockchain technology? You've probably heard of Bitcoin, which originally aimed to be a global, decentralized, digital currency. Bitcoin was the first major Cryptocurrency, but what other use cases are there for the blockchain?

### Blockchain innovation
Having a global, digital currency is an interesting idea. There are thousands of applications for blockchain technology which are based on improving current working systems:

* **Ripple**, which is designed for peer-to-peer debt transfer

* **Monero**, a privacy coin with a focus on anonymous transactions

* **Tether**, a cryptocurrency aimed at being equal to the USD, mostly used for converting to other cryptocurrencies

* **Ethereum**, a cryptocurrency which supports Turing-complete smart contracts, enabling users to do things such as trustless auctions

* **KodakCoin**, a coin which aims to allow photographers to have more control licensing their photos.
  
## Why is blockchain technology so new and different?
Blockchains allow people to store information in a distributed, permanent, immutable ledger. This has led to innovations like Swarm, a censorship-resistant online file storage system. A system where content is put up and can not be removed by any centralized authority has very powerful implications; people with money or power couldn't bully the owner into taking down content that doesn't agree with them. A potential real-world use case for this would be a whistleblower putting up sensitive documents that prove his employer is doing something illegal. Having it permanently recorded ensures that the employer couldn't pay someone to take it down, like they could for a centralized file storage site with one owner.

Another potential use case could be for supply chain management; for example, say you wanted to purchase some fresh, organic strawberries from California, but you live on the other side of the US. You go into your local supermarket, and there's a box of strawberries that say "certified organic from California". How can you know that these strawberries came from where they said?

If you want to buy a new cellphone; how can you tell that it's legitimate, and not a knockoff? Was it built in a facory that uses child labor?

Using a blockchain, all points at which the strawberries changed hands could be recorded, permanently and transparently. Each part in your phone had to be created somewhere, and each of those parts changing hands could be recorded on a blockchain, allowing you to look up where all the parts form your specific phone came from, and look into the companies producing them, to make sure they're doing everything above board and properly.

With Ethereum smart contracts, it's possible to write a program or application that lives on the blockchain which allows users to interact with it and run the contract. A smart contract could be created to donate money to charity. Users would look up the smart contract, and be able to read its code, verifying that the money they send to the contract will be sent to the charity's address on the blockchain.
