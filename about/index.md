# About Us
Welcome to Blockstreet. This site was founded by a group of engineers, and entrepreneurs that are all brought together by a mutual interest in Blockchain technology and its promise to change the world. During our time following and getting involved in the cryptocurrency community, we noticed some things we can improve on.

There are plenty of sites that report cryptocurrency news, show you the latest price ticker, and give you information about existing and upcoming currencies; but none of them do it in a simple, straightforward way.

From our observations, we noticed that:
* A lot of people _have never heard of cryptocurrency._
* A lot of people who have heard of cryptocurrency _do not actually know what it is._
* A lot of people who know what cryptocurrency is _do not know how it works._

At Blockstreet we want to teach people the many concepts of Cryptocurrency, how blockchain technology can change the world, and how to get involved. Through education, we want to open up understanding and opportunities to as many people as possible. Our written content will be supported by artwork and animations to help connect complex blockchain concepts to things from everyday life.

Our education section covers some basics of cryptocurrency with analogies that help people build a mental model of how blockchain technology works. We hope to grow it into a complete guide that covers the inner workings of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
