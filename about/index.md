# About Us
Welcome to Blockstreet. This site was founded by a group of engineers, entrepreneurs and security professionals that are all brought together by a mutual interest in Blockchain technology and its promise to change the world. During our time following and getting involved in the cryptocurrency community, we noticed some things we can improve on.

There are plenty of sites that report cryptocurrency news, show you the latest price ticker, and give you information about existing and upcoming currencies; but none of them do it in a simple, straightforward way.

From our observations, we noticed that:
* A lot of people _have never heard of cryptocurrency._
* A lot of people who have heard of cryptocurrency _do not actually know what it is._
* A lot of people who know what cryptocurrency is _do not know how it works._

We at Blockstreet want to teach these groups of people how cryptocurrencies work, how they can change the world, and how they can get involved. We want to make things easy and open up understanding and opportunities to as many people as we can so that we can get them involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We want to present information in a way that anyone can understand. We will support the written content with artwork and animations when we can to make things more understandable.

Blockstreet aims to become the go-to source for anybody interested in the blockchain ecosystem. We want to be the place people send their friends and family to learn about cryptocurrency.

Our education section covers some basics of cryptocurrency with analogies that help people build a mental model of how blockchain technology works. We hope to grow it into a complete guide that covers the inner workings of systems that cryptocurrencies from A to Z.
