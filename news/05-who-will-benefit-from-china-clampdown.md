It has been a tumultuous few weeks for Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies. Towards the end of the "Summer of Bitcoin" (in which the Bitcoin price saw a more than threefold rise since the start of May), a series of setbacks over the past couple of weeks caused a tumble in the price of the currency from it's $4,969 high.

Chief among these was an increased clampdown on cryptocurrencies from the Chinese authorities. This included the news that all exchanges (which allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat currency) are to close by the end of September, a banning of new Initial Coin offerings (known as ICOs, which is when a new cryptocurrency token is first offered to traders), and a general disapproving tone from authorities regarding cryptocurrencies.

Over a quarter of all Bitcoin transactions as well as a huge proportion of the mining activity happens in China, so whatever the authorities there do has a big effect on the cryptosphere. But despite the price drops, the Chinese clampdown is not bad news for everyone in the industry. The growth of cryptocurrencies has shown that users will work hard to circumvent unwanted government regulation which can benefit new players in the industry. 

#### Alternative exchanges?
In the aftermath of China's recent announcements, there has been a surge of new users to peer-to-peer platforms like LocalBitcoins. This situation may not last, since there have been conflicting rumors about whether these platforms will be forced to close with the other exchanges. It’s anyone's guess, although based on a report from September 18th it looks likely they will be forced to close.

Two things are clear. First, if peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins survive the clampdown, they will gain influence and revenue from the aftermath. Expect these peer-to-peer exchanges to take the place of the existing exchanges and get much more exposure, at least in the time after regular exchanges close and before the next iteration of exchanges in China are permitted to start up.

Second, cryptocurrencies have thrived in the face of regulation in the past (and circumventing government regulation this is part of the reason they exist). You can also expect an innovative quasi black-market of trading solutions to rise in the place of the exchanges.

#### NEO
China's answer to Ethereum looks set to gain long-term from the instability in the country. The NEO team have made a great play of adhering to the rules of the authorities, and since ICOs are now banned it seems like NEO is uniquely placed to benefit from a situation in China where ICOs and exchanges are banned and they are one of the few players left standing.

#### Other countries
There is considerable buzz around crypto in Asia at the moment, and China's loss is other countries' gain. OmiseGo, a Thai-Japanese project which is unfazed by the ban, is enjoying a positive reception from the crypto community. Estonia has announced a new move to create the first country-backed coin. Crypto capital and investment are expected to flow to Japan and Korea among other countries as a result of the ban.While China’s government tries to stifle crypto, the Japanese company Oki has plans to  distribute its cryptocurrency ATM in southeast Asia. It is clear that government regulations aren’t affecting all cryptocurrencies similarly, and the overall cryptosphere continues to thrive. 

#### Uncertain future, resilient ecosystem
If there is a demand for a solution, there is little one government can do to combat it. Clampdowns like this one should only serve to diversify the ecosystem, as one insider put it. However, it is worth pointing out that the same insider also explains that heavyweights like the Chinese government going up against Bitcoin is not what the industry needs right now. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next couple of weeks when the clampdown shakes out fully.
