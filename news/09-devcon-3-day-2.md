As hundreds of developers poured into the main hall of the International Convention Center in Cancun, the second day of DEVCON 3 was quickly underway. Péter Szilágyi kicked off the day with his presentation titled “Developers Developers Developers”, where he discussed the several options that Ethereum developers have to assist them such as Truffle and the Ropsten test net, while also identifying some of the problems that arise from using these tools. He went on to talk about Puppeth which alleviates these issues.

Next up in the main hall was Marcus Ligi to present the android application WALLETH. He went into detail about the importance of Ethereum accessibility on mobile. There was a heavy focus on the user experience side of development to introduce as little friction as possible.

Following up Marcus’ presentation was Jarrad Hope from Status that had a wealth of new announcements. We learned that Status will be deploying to all platforms (iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows and Linux) using React Native. Status will be using near field communication (NFC) technology in the form of a card to confirm transactions made on your phone, turning it into a hardware wallet.

The afternoon in the breakout room was filled with back to back presentations on smart contract security where we were learned about different tools that Zepplin and the ICS were building.
