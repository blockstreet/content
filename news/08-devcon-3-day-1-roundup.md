The first day at Devcon 3 was described as nothing short of "the most successful Devcon ever", by the Ethereum Foundation's Executive Director, Ming Chan. Several talks by prominent figures in the community touched upon both current and future problems for Ethereum, and the community's plans to alleviate them.

The agenda was filled with highly technical presentations with a total of 29 talks taking place in the main hall and a single break off room.

Vitalik opened the day with his yearly talk "Ethereum in 25 minutes, version 2017" where he went into detail about what Ethereum is. Immediately after the opening, a presentation on Casper was given in the break off room by Chang Wu-Chen, but the talk was unreachable by many due to the sheer amount of people crowded in.

After lunch Emin Gun Sirer, a professor from Cornell University, gave a wonderful presentation in the breakoff room on Challenges Ahead for Smart Contracts where he discussed off-chain scaling solutions, mentioned his project CreDB which will allow private storage of data that is accessible through the blockchain. This presentation was also filled to the brim with knowledge hungry developers. He also went into detail about trusted exceution environments that could be used in these off-chain scaling solutions, which are part of the CPU's of major manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, and arm.

Later on in the day, Vlad Zamfir gave a presentation on Casper, the friendly finality ghost which was very heavy on mathematical proofs. This was followed up by a panel with Vlad, Vitalik, Emin and Peter Czaban where they discussed it further, and took questions from the audience.

Vitalik topped off the day with a presentation on sharding, the issues facing Ethereum on scalability, and the foundation's innovative solutions for achieving it. It was announced that Casper and Proof of Stake was just around the corner, and the details of it are near finalization. Progress has begun on the implementation of sharding as well, and can be followed on the foundation's Github page.

Overall, the day was a massive success, and the Blockstreet team was very excited to attend, and meet the wonderful people who are part of the Blockchain space. We look forward to meeting other Blockchain enthusiasts at the Unicorn Party at Elevate tonight, and in the proceeding days of the conference.
